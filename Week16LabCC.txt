Week 16

Day 01
SPRINGBOOT
H2 Console /JPA+H2/

H2 +JPA Crud ....
Library DB/Table ....
H2+JPA+Thymeleaf ....

As part of the IT Dev Team developing the School Mgmt System, requirement has risen to implement a module for 
Library Mgmt and you are asked to create a facility for the management of Library details, as part of this,the  initial
module is supposed to allow the CRUD operations for the LIbrary information
Library Entity is supposed to have the following details:

Library
	 	id;
		name;
	 	commaSeperatedBooknames;
		subject
		publisher

Since the Administration wants to manage this using embedded DB, you are asked to Create a SpringBoot Application with 
JPA and the Database to be used is H2 with Thymeleaf as Template Engine.
------------------------------------------------------
On Day 01
Create the Project STructure with all MVC Layers aling with Repository Layer plus UI to perform read Operations
Dependencies to be added:
Web, JPA, H2, Thymeleaf,Lombok, Actuator(Optional) & DevTools

------------------------------------------------------
Day 02
Continuing the Project that was created on Day 01 add functionalities to do the following operations
	Update
	Create
	Delete
Along with the following filtering operations using JPA:
a) Library With No Books
b) Library viewed by Sorting, based on the field/column selected in a Drop Down
(Option is given through radio buttons to choose the sorting order as Ascending or Descending)
c) Option to choose top X records from 0th record
d) Option to choose Page Number and No of records per page

All the above options are to be choosen by providing Radio Buttons in the List Page 


SELECT * FROM LIBRARY 

delete from Library where ID = 0;


insert into library
values(1,'Book1,Book2,Book3','Library1','Publisher1','Psychology');
CRUD WORKING
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 03-
1)
Create a Simple RESTFul App using SpringBoot to print "Hello , Welcome to the RESTFul Services"
Implement @RestController
Configure Swagger and invoke swagger-ui.html page to view the Documentation page

Invoke The RESTFul API using PostMan
Also as part of Migration plan from Web Application to WebServices, 
Library Mgmt System - may be requiring an upgrade, therefore a SpringBoot based RestFul Service is to be created
But The DB connectivity is simulated through the Collections and actual DB connectivity is to be done later.
 
Library Entity with the following fields
long id;
String name;
commaSeperatedBooknames;
String subject;
String publisher;

Create DAO,Model,Service & Controller Layers 
List of Library Objects is created and facilitate
GetAllLibrary, GetLibraryById,DeleteLibraryById,InsertLibrary & UpdateLibrary Operations

Use POSTMan to test the Application



Day 04
------------------------------------------------
CCRepDetails CRUD Operation through Restful Service

2) 
As Part of the UI-Development Team you are asked to  migrate the part of the Customer Care Mgmt System into

a RESTFul Service with CRUD operations
Using JPA & MySQL as RDBMS
Implement Lombok, DevTools,Swagger
Test The Application with POSTMan
